                <p>I have completed my undergraduate from the University of Liberal Arts, Bangladesh. Although I have majored in marketing, my interest lies in anything creative from arts to film making. Currently I am devoting my time to learn my newly found passion, web development and coding. I wants to establish a meaningful career working in a field where I can express my creativity and explore solutions to the countless problems in our society.</p> <br>

                <h3>“Don't wait for inspiration. <br> It comes while working." - Henri Matisse</h3>
                <p>I always try to work on things which inspires me and which I feel passionate about. My works are different than each other. Because when I work on anything, I make sure I create something creative and express my feelings through that work.</p>

                <h3> Short Film <span style="color: rgb(150, 11, 11);">" The Truth "</span> Directed By Nowshin</h3>
                <p> This film was for a film making competition and it was my first time in this kind of competiton. So I considered getting the opportunity to be a part of this film making competition is a big achievement of my life. Although I thought about it before but this is the very first film I have directed on but definitely will not be the last one. I have learned immensely throughout this process and considered the opportunity humbling and eye opening.</p>

                <p> I have dreamed this art for a long time but I couldn't make it because of the artist block. This is my first art work on a Canvas which is really special and precious for me. </p>
